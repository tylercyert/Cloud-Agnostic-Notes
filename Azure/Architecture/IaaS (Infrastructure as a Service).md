## **Overview**
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a **cloud computing model** where a provider delivers **virtualized computing resources** (servers, storage, networking) over the internet. Customers rent infrastructure on demand instead of owning and maintaining physical datacenters.
## **Details**
- **What you manage**  
	- Operating system  
	- Middleware  
	- Applications  
	- Data  
- **What the provider manages**  
	- Physical servers  
	- Networking hardware  
	- Storage systems  
	- Datacenter facilities  
- **Key Benefits**  
	- **On-demand scaling** → Adjust resources as needed.  
	- **Pay-as-you-go pricing** → Only pay for what you use.  
	- **Flexibility** → Run any OS or workload.  
	- **Lift-and-shift migration** → Move on-premises apps to cloud without major changes.  
- **Examples**  
	- [[Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)]]  
	- AWS EC2  
	- Google Compute Engine  
## **Exam Tips**
- IaaS = **rented infrastructure**.  
- You manage **OS + apps + data**, provider manages **hardware + networking**.  
- Best for **custom environments, legacy apps, or when full control is needed**.  
- Compare to:  
	- **PaaS** → Provider manages OS + runtime.  
	- **SaaS** → Provider manages everything (just use the app).
