- **Azure Account**: An identity (user, group, or service principal) that has assigned roles and permissions to access and manage [[Azure resources]].  
- **Subscription**: A container that holds [[Azure services]]/resources. Defines billing, access boundaries, and quotas. You can think of it like an **organizational unit (OU)** for cloud resources.  
- **Resource Group**: A logical container within a subscription that groups related resources together for management, deployment, and lifecycle purposes.  
- **Resource**: An individual [[Azure service]] instance (e.g., a [[Virtual Machines (VMs)|VM]], [[Storage accounts]], [[Azure SQL Database]], or web app).
