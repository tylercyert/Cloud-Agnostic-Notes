## **Overview**
This domain covers **identity, access, and security** concepts in Azure.  
It introduces **directory services**, authentication methods, access control, and security models like **Zero Trust** and **defense in depth**.  
It also covers tools like **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** to protect resources against threats.

## **Notes**

### **Identity & Directory Services**
- [[Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)]]  
- [[Microsoft Entra Domain Services (Managed Domain)]]  

### **Authentication & Access**
- [[Single Sign-On (SSO)]]  
- [[Multifactor Authentication (MFA)]]  
- [[Passwordless Authentication]]  
- [[External Identities & Guest Access]]  
- [[Microsoft Entra Conditional Access]]  
- [[Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)]]  

### **Security Models**
- [[Zero Trust Security Model]]  
- [[Defense in Depth Model]]  

### **Security Tools**
- [[Microsoft Defender for Cloud]]

## **Exam Tips**
- **Entra ID vs Domain Services** → Cloud-native identity vs legacy domain-join compatibility.  
- **Authentication** → Know the difference between SSO, MFA, and passwordless.  
- **Access control** → RBAC is role-based, Conditional Access is context-based (e.g., device, location).  
- **Zero Trust** → Never trust, always verify.  
- **Defense in depth** → Multiple layers: identity, perimeter, network, compute, apps, data.  
- **Defender for Cloud** → Threat protection + posture management.
