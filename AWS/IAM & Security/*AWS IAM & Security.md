## **Overview**
The **IAM & Security** domain covers AWS services and concepts that manage **user identities, access control, and security protections** for workloads in the cloud.  
It ensures compliance, governance, and protection against threats while enabling secure access to resources.

## **Details**
- **Identity & Access Management**
	- [[AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)]] – Manage users, groups, roles, and policies.  
	- [[AWS Organizations & Accounts]] – Multi-account management, consolidated billing, service control policies.  
	- [[AWS Cognito]] – Identity for apps (sign-up, sign-in, federation).  

- **Security & Protection**
	- [[AWS Shield & WAF]] – DDoS protection and web application firewall.  
	- [[AWS CloudTrail & CloudWatch]] – Logging, monitoring, and governance.  

- **Shared Responsibility**
	- [[AWS Shared Responsibility Model]] – Split of security duties between AWS and customers.  

## **Exam Tips**
- **IAM** = fine-grained access management (users, roles, policies).  
- **Organizations** = account hierarchy and consolidated billing.  
- **Cognito** = authentication/authorization for web/mobile apps.  
- **Shield = DDoS**, **WAF = filter HTTP requests**.  
- **CloudTrail** = records API calls, **CloudWatch** = monitoring/metrics/alerts.  
- Always recall: **AWS secures OF the cloud, customers secure IN the cloud**.
