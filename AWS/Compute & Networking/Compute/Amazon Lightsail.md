## **Overview**
**Amazon Lightsail** is a simplified cloud platform that provides **easy-to-use virtual private servers (VPS)** with bundled compute, storage, and networking.  
It’s designed for developers, small businesses, and workloads that don’t need the full flexibility of [[Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)]] and [[Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)]].

## **Details**
- **Core Features**
	- Preconfigured **virtual servers (instances)** with a fixed monthly price.  
	- Includes **compute, storage, data transfer, DNS management, and static IPs**.  
	- Simplifies cloud setup with minimal configuration.  

- **Use Cases**
	- Hosting simple websites and blogs.  
	- Running small business applications.  
	- Development and test environments.  
	- Learning cloud basics without complexity.

	- **Databases** – Managed MySQL/PostgreSQL with automated backups.  
	- **Networking** – Load balancers, DNS zones, static IP addresses.  
	- **Storage** – Block storage and object storage (S3-compatible buckets).  
	- **Containers** – Lightsail container service for containerized apps.  

- **Pricing**
	- **Predictable monthly plans** (includes fixed compute, storage, and bandwidth).  
	- Cheaper and simpler than EC2 for small workloads.  

- **Integration**
	- Can connect with other AWS services (e.g., migrate workloads into EC2/VPC for scaling).  
	- Export to **EC2** for advanced configurations.  

## **Exam Tips**
- Lightsail = **simple, predictable VPS** solution.  
- Use for **small-scale apps, websites, or learning environments**.  
- EC2 = flexible & powerful; Lightsail = **ease of use & fixed pricing**.  
- Can **migrate Lightsail workloads to EC2** if scaling is needed.
