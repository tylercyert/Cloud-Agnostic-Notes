## **Exam Tips**
- **Amazon WorkSpaces = DaaS** (desktop virtualization in AWS).  
- Always integrates with **Directory Services** for identity.  
- Secure alternative to physical desktops; data never leaves AWS.  
- **WorkSpaces vs AppStream 2.0**:  
	- WorkSpaces = full persistent desktop.  
	- AppStream 2.0 = streaming of individual apps (no full desktop).
