## **Overview**
The **Compute & Networking** domain covers the core services that power workloads in AWS. It includes **virtual servers, serverless computing, networking, and connectivity services** that let you build scalable and secure cloud architectures.  

This hub note links to all foundational compute and networking services.

## **Details**
- **Compute**
	- [[Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)]] – Virtual servers in the cloud.  
	- [[AWS Lambda (Serverless)]] – Run code without managing servers.  
	- [[Amazon Lightsail]] – Simplified compute with bundled networking and storage.  

- **Networking**
	- [[Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)]] – Isolated cloud network for resources.  
	- [[Amazon Route 53]] – Scalable DNS and domain registration.  
	- [[AWS Direct Connect]] – Dedicated private network connection to AWS.  

- **Scalability & Load Management**
	- [[AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) & Auto Scaling]] – Distribute traffic and adjust capacity.  

## **Exam Tips**
- **EC2 = servers**, **Lambda = serverless**, **Lightsail = simple bundles**.  
- **VPC = networking foundation**; subnets, route tables, security groups.  
- **Route 53** = DNS + routing policies (latency, weighted, failover).  
- **Direct Connect** = private link to AWS, not over the internet.  
- **ELB + Auto Scaling** = core of high availability architectures.
